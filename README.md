# Paperback-themes
### This is a repository containing all current Paperback themes and templates so you can make your own theme yourself.

---

Since the 0.7 release Paperback has the option to make and use a custom theme in the app.

The standard theme the app uses is the "**DefaultColors**" file.

I personally made a couple themes that you guys can use in case you are interested.

There are 2 type of themes that I made, the first are basic themes.
This changes everything that's red in the standard theme (this does not include buttons which have destructive functions (like "Clear")):

1) **BasicCelaryeBlueColors**: the same blue as my personal Paperback discord role.
2) **BasicPaperbackBlueColors**: the blue available on Paperback.moe (under settings).
3) **BasicPaperbackRedColors**: the red available on Paperback.moe (under settings).
4) **BasicPaperbackPurpleColors**: the purple available on Paperback.moe (under settings).
5) **BasicCherryBlossomPinkColors**: the pink color from chery blossom trees.

The other type are advanced themes.
This currently has some readability issues in the manga viewer but paper (Paperback developer) will fix this in a future update.
These are themes that also change the color of the background, certain boxes and text:

1) **AdvancedZikoBlueColors**: A theme made by @zikofurito#2238 (with me who added light mode compatibility and made some other fixes).
2) **AdvancedCelaryeDiscordColors**: A theme based on the standard Discord colors!
3) **AdvancedCelaryeTwitterColors**: Coming soon!
4) **AdvancedCelaryeAniListColors**: Coming soon!
5) **AdvancedCelaryePurpleColors**: Coming soon!

To implement any of these themes into Paperback you'll have to share the file with the Paperback app (the same way you do with a backup) from the device you want to change the theme on.

I also made a template file for both the basic theme and advanced theme so you can easily make your own theme, this are the "**BasicTemplate**" and "**AdvancedTemplate**" files. I recommend opening this with a text reader (like Notepad(++)) on PC or the QuickText app on IOS. A guide on how to use it can be found in the file itself.

You may always DM me on discord (Celarye#3602) regarding questions about this.
