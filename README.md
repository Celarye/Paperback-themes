## FAQ

### Frequently asked questions regarding themes in the app.

**1. How do I install/implement a theme?**

To implement a theme into the app you will have to share the file with the app (the same way you do with a backup) from the device you want to change the theme on. After this restart the app to make sure it is fully implemented.

**2. Can a theme file harm me or my device in any way?**

No, these files are basic JSON's which only change color values in the app.

**3. How do I reset my theme to the standard one?**

The standard theme the app uses is the "**DefaultTheme**" file, share this file with the app to reset your app to the standard theme.

**4. Can I make my own theme?**

You may always make a request for a theme in the Github repository by making a feature request or on Discord by DMing me. However, if you rather make a theme yourself I recommend checking out "**Theme creation**" bellow this FAQ.

## Theme creation

### Info regarding theme creation for the app.

I made a template file so you can easily make your own theme, this is the "**Template**" file and can be found in the Github repository. I recommend opening this with [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on PC or [Runestone](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893) on IOS. A guide on how to use it can be found in the file itself. And feel free to DM me (@Celarye# 0001 on Discord) the themes you made so I can add them to the public repository and Paperback Discord.

***DISCLAIMER:***

*All themes you make and want to be added to the public repository and Paperback Discord under your name will have to be made with the "**Template**" file (without any line starting with "//" removed).*
*You will not have to follow the guide in the template for 100% but if you don't you will need to justify it (however, both light and dark mode support is mandatory).*

*If this isn't the case I will have to rework them and not credit you because this process takes quite some time to do.*

*These rules are to increase efficiency and quality of the themes.*

*Also make sure to not make any themes I or someone else got planned already (check the README for that and let me know which ones you are planning on making so I can add it to the README as well).*
