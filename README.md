# Paperback-themes
### This is a repository containing all public Paperback themes and templates so you can make your own theme yourself.

---

Since the 0.7 release Paperback has the option to make and use a custom theme in the app.

The standard theme the app uses is the "**DefaultColors**" file.

I personally made a couple themes that you guys can use in case you are interested (if the theme wasn't originally made by me then the original creator is mentioned in the theme it's description).

There are 2 type of themes that I made, the first are basic themes.
This changes everything that's red in the standard theme (this does not include buttons which have destructive functions (like "Clear")):

1) **CelaryeBlue**: A theme based on the blue color of my personal Paperback discord role.
2) **PaperbackBlue**: A theme based on the blue theme on Paperback.moe.
3) **PaperbackRed**: A theme based on the red theme on Paperback.moe.
4) **PaperbackPurple**: A theme based on the purple theme on Paperback.moe.
5) **CherryBlossomPink**: A theme based on the pink color of cherry blossom trees.
6) **Turquoise**: A theme based on the color turquoise.
7) **NEW: Green**: A theme based on the color green!

The other type are advanced themes.
These are themes that also change the color of the foreground, background, text and other elements:

1) **BlueDiscord**: A theme based on a blue discord theme (original creator: @zikofurito#2238, reworked by me).
2) **DarkDiscord**: A theme based on the dark Discord theme.
3) **DarkDiscordAndPink**: A theme based on the dark Discord theme but with pink elements.
4) **DefaultTwitter**: A theme based on the default Twitter theme.
5) **AniList**: A theme based on the AniList theme, coming soon!


To implement any of these themes into Paperback you'll have to share the file with the Paperback app (the same way you do with a backup) from the device you want to change the theme on. After this restart the app to make sure it's fully implemented.

I also made template files for both the basic theme and advanced theme so you can easily make your own theme, this are the "**BasicTemplate**" and "**AdvancedTemplate**" files and can be found in the Github repository. I recommend opening this with a text reader (like Notepad++ or VSC) on PC or the QuickText app on IOS. A guide on how to use it can be found in the file itself. And you can always DM me (on Discord (Celarye#3602)) the themes you made so I can add them to the repository and Paperback Discord.

You may always DM me on discord (Celarye#3602) regarding any questions about this.
